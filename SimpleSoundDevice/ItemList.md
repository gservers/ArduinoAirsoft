Deceive your Enemys by making a noise.

What do i need to build?
1x Attiny85
1x LED (choose a colouer, but it should be a 5V LED)
1x 433MHz reveiver
1x 330 Ohm Resistor (Orange Orange Brown)
1x Buzzer/Beeper
1x Diode
1x Something to Solder on (perfboard or copperwire)
2x Capacitors (1x 10 and 1x 100 mikro Farad)
(1x antenna for the receiver, if you haven't got one with it)

Batteries and Holder:
you need a total output between 4.5 and 5.5 Volt
So you could use: 
4x rechargeable 1.2V AA Batteries and no Diode
4x normal 1.5V AA Batteries and a Diode (ends in 5.3V)
2x button cells with 3V and a Diode (ends in 5.3V)
or plenty other power sources.

Keep in mind, that the Diode is optional, but recommended.

What do i need to program?
1x Arduino
1x Capacitor (10 mikro Farad)
1x Breadboard
Some Jumper Wires

What else?
You need some consumables and tons of other stuff....
Just kidding:
1x Soldering Iron
some solder
Someting to protect anything angainst wind and weather (like a case)
