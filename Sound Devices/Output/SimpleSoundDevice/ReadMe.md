<h3>How does it work</h3>
After supplying Power, the LED starts to Blink.<br>
You now have to give your child a name, by repeating it 4 Times.<br>
The LED now turns on until you resend the name.<br>
Now you can Resend the name to toggle between Sound and the LED (on is on the other is off)<br>
To give it another name, just cut off the power supply<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Every Name is possible, just send it with a speed of 1000 Byts/Second.
