Deceive your Enemys by making a noise. <br>
 <br>
What do i need to build? <br>
1x Attiny85 <br>
1x LED (choose a colouer, but it should be a 5V LED) <br>
1x 433MHz reveiver <br>
1x 330 Ohm Resistor (Orange Orange Brown) <br>
1x Buzzer/Beeper <br>
1x Diode <br>
1x On/Off Switch<br>
1x Something to Solder on (perfboard or copperwire) <br>
2x Capacitors (1x 10 and 1x 100 mikro Farad) <br>
(1x antenna for the receiver, if you haven't got one with it) <br>
 <br>
Batteries and Holder: <br>
you need a total output between 4.5 and 5.5 Volt <br>
So you could use:  <br>
4x rechargeable 1.2V AA Batteries and no Diode <br>
4x normal 1.5V AA Batteries and a Diode (ends in 5.3V) <br>
2x button cells with 3V and a Diode (ends in 5.3V) <br>
or plenty other power sources. <br>
 <br>
Keep in mind, that the Diode is optional, but recommended. <br>
 <br>
What do i need to program? <br>
1x Arduino <br>
1x Capacitor (10 mikro Farad) <br>
1x Breadboard <br>
Some Jumper Wires <br>

 <br>
What else? <br>
You need some consumables and tons of other stuff.... <br>
Just kidding: <br>
1x Soldering Iron <br>
some solder <br>
Someting to protect anything angainst wind and weather (like a case) <br>
